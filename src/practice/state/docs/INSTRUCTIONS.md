# Save/Load States

This document logs our findings, analysis, and architecture specifications for the practice ROM's save/load state functionality, serving as a guide for future developers and AI agents.

You should update this document whenever new information is learned. Keep it concise and information-dense.

If you have been told to continue work on this feature, read the "current goal" section below to understand what we want to achieve. Also look at the key learnings and struct analysis for helpful information and leads to continue investigating.

Above all, make sure you investigate thoroughly to fully understand where pieces of data are used, their purpose and the implications of setting them to certain values on load. Once confident about a piece of data, add it to the save/load system, document your findings in this file, and stop and tell the user about what you found and how they can test it. Do not continue work unless the user explicitly tells you to.

## Current Goal

Currently we want to be able to save and load the state of each type of prop.

### Next Goals

After the current goal we will need to handle:

- [done] Bond
- [current] Props (PropRecord type-by-type)
- NPCs (position, animation, AI, etc.)
- Global state (mission timer, objectives, etc.)

## Prompt

Read through this entire document and implement another prop type into the save/load system. Make sure to:

- Choose a new prop to implement
- Prioritize props that are simple (ie. not pointers or things that need to be kept in sync with other things)
- Document their purpose, possible values, etc. in the docs files the same way as the existing fields using the same format, and move them out of the TODO section
- Tell me what to do in the game to test that it works and doesn't crash/hang
- No need to update the changelog or walkthrough

## Key Learnings

Add any general advice helpful for future agents working on this feature here. Be sure to read and understand these before starting work on handling more state in the system.

- **Implement one feature at a time then manually test**: Since crashes and hangs are so common and can be unexpectedly caused by even seemingly innocuous changes, implement a small number of safe properties in the save/load code. After this, update this file and report back to the user what was added, what was learned and what they should now do in the game to test that the newly added properties are loaded correctly.
- **Stale Pointers**: Any struct member ending in `*` (e.g., `ALSoundState *`, `ObjectRecord *`, `PropRecord *`) is an absolute memory address. If the game engine deallocates or reallocates the target object, loading a saved state that retains the old pointer will cause a crash. All such pointers must either be relocated (mapped back to correct indices) or it will not affect gameplay nullified (set to `NULL`).
- **Sound System Crashing**: Sound structures (`ALSoundState`) are allocated dynamically. Nullifying properties like `audioHandle`, `openSoundState`, and `closeSoundState` upon loading prevents the sound engine from trying to modify a defunct sound node.
- **NULL Prop Handling (Cutscenes vs Gameplay)**: The player's world physical presence `g_CurrentPlayer->prop` is `NULL` during intro cutscenes, level loading, or death. When loading a saved state:
    - Track whether the saved state had a valid prop using a `has_prop` boolean flag.
    - If the saved state has a prop but the current player does not (e.g., loading gameplay into a cutscene), allocate a new prop using `chrpropAllocate()`, initialize its fields, activate it, enable it, and register it to its rooms.
    - If the saved state does not have a prop but the current player does (e.g., loading a cutscene into active gameplay), deregister, delist, disable, and free the current player prop using `chrpropDeregisterRooms`, `chrpropDelist`, `chrpropDisable`, and `chrpropFree`.
    - If both have a prop, update its coordinates and rooms safely using room deregistration/registration.

## Struct Analysis

Keep all the properties of the structs and global variables we save and load in files in this directory. Document them and their properties, along with whether they affect gameplay, their status in the save/load code and any other important information. Use this as a guide when reading source code to understand what each property does.

If you are missing any information about a struct or variable, mark with a TODO comment what should still be investigated and documented.
